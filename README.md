# Koala Website

> Welcome to my dedicated koala website, where you can dive deep into the enchanting world of these unique marsupials. This site is a passion project, offering a comprehensive collection of interesting facts and detailed information about koalas. Whether you're curious about their behavior, habitat, or conservation status, you'll find a wealth of knowledge here. Alongside informative content, the site features beautiful images that capture the charm and personality of these iconic Australian animals. As the author, I've poured my love for koalas into every corner of this site, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out through the contact page—I’d love to hear your thoughts, questions, or simply chat about all things koalas!

This website was originally created in partial fulfillment of my Introduction to Computing course during my first year of college in 2022, marking it as my very first foray into web development. The project was conceived with a deep appreciation for koalas, aiming to provide a comprehensive and visually engaging resource on these remarkable creatures. This endeavor not only reflects my growing interest in both technology and wildlife conservation but also serves as a testament to the foundational skills I acquired during my initial year of study.
